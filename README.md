Harry Nixon â€“ CV Site
=====================

How to use
----------
1) Unzip the archive.
2) Open `index.html` in your browser.
3) Replace the placeholder portfolio URL (inside the Experience section) with your real Google Drive link by editing `index.html`.
4) If you want to swap QR images, place new files in `assets/qr-portfolio.png` and `assets/qr-youtube.png` and reload.

You can deploy this anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host).

Good luck!
